I am a Ph.D. student at the [Department of Economics](https://economics.yale.edu/), Yale University. I have a broad interest in the theoretical problems of economics and algorithmic economics, especially information design and mechanism design. Previously, I was an undergraduate student and a master student at [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University. 

Here is my personal [CV](/files/Yi_Liu_s_CV.pdf).
