I am a third-year master student at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/) (IIIS), Tsinghua University. I have a broad interest in the theoretical problems of economics and algorithmic economics, especially information design and mechanism design. Previously, I was an undergraduate student in Yao Class, at Tsinghua University. 

Here is my personal [CV](/files/Yi_Liu_s_CV.pdf).
