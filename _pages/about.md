I am a second-year master student at Institute for [Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/) (IIIS), Tsinghua University. I am now advised by Yang Yu and Yi Wu. I have a broad interest in the theoretical problems of economics and algorithmic economics, especially information design and mechanism design. Previously, I was an undergraduate student in Yao Class, Tsinghua University.

Here is my personal [CV](/files/CV.pdf).
