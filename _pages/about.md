I am a second-year master student at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/) (IIIS), Tsinghua University. I am now fortunately advised by Prof. Yang Yu and Prof. [Yi Wu](https://jxwuyi.weebly.com/). I have a broad interest in the theoretical problems of economics and algorithmic economics, especially information design and mechanism design. Previously, I was an undergraduate student in Yao Class, at Tsinghua University. I have worked with a lot of nice and insightful people, Prof. [Zhonghong Kuang](https://zhkuang.weebly.com/), Prof. [Sanxi Li](http://econ.ruc.edu.cn/jszy/4e35b71d197a4e23911b7a761b67780e.htm) and Dr. [Fan Wu](https://wuf17.weebly.com/). Many of them helped me a lot in several aspects. I am also indebted to them.

Here is my personal [CV](/files/Yi_Liu_s_CV.pdf).
